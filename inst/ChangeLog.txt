Version 0.6.3
-------------

- omp.h is conditionally included depending on the OpenMP support of the target system


Version 0.6.2
-------------

- removed function arguments for SAS- and R-quantiles, 'type=2' (the default) is equivalent to SAS PCTLDEF5 which is
  used in the C-implementation
- documentation revised and new examples added 
- CRAN release candidate version


Version 0.6.1
-------------

- removed source-code snippet writing status textfile to U:/Test/..., which had been forgotten
  to remove when building last package version


Version 0.6
-------------

- DLLs now correctly loaded for '1386' vs 'x64' architectures, in previous version the 'i386' DLL was loaded
  every time, which caused an error
- parallel-processing is now possible via R-package 'parallel' and OpenMP on C-level
- the rank-based algorithm for construction of STBs was added and is used as the default-method; it was corrected
  compared to the published description


Version 0.5
-----------

- function 'stb.VCA' added, computing simultaneous tolerance bounds for random effects or residuals of 
  'VCA' objects created with R-package 'VCA'
- function 'plot.stbVCA' added for plotting 'stbVCA' objects returned by function 'stb.VCA'


Version 0.4.1
-------------

- new implementation of function 'SASquantile' used, fixing a bug computing quantiles among integer values
- (rolnyv) SASquantile-function: 1st argument changed from 'v' to 'x' to be in line with
  standard R-function definitions
- in function 'SASquantile' argument 'tol' was added controlling what the function interprets 
  as equivalent to zero when applying the SAS PCTLDEF5 algorithm fixing a bug reproducible using:
    SASquantile(1:100, .75)
    SASquantile(1:100, seq(.05, .95, .05))["75%"]


Version 0.4
-----------

- adapted to be compatible with R versions >= 3.0.0
- there seems to be a problem with X64-DLL, which might result in errors calling C-code in 64-Bit R-environments 
  (needs to be fixed in the future)


Version 0.3
-----------

- documentation fixed
- package revised to pass R CMD check


Version 0.2
-----------

- it is now possible to add the simultaneous tolerance band to an existing plot (add=TRUE)
- documentation was revised
